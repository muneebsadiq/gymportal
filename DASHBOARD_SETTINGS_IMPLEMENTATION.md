# Dashboard & Settings Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Dashboard Revenue & Payments Calculation

**Problem**: Monthly revenue and recent payments were not updating correctly.

**Solution**: Updated `DashboardController.php` to only count payments with status 'paid' or 'partial':

```php
// Monthly Revenue - Now filters by status
$monthlyRevenue = Payment::whereMonth('payment_date', Carbon::now()->month)
    ->whereYear('payment_date', Carbon::now()->year)
    ->whereIn('status', ['paid', 'partial'])
    ->sum('amount');

// Revenue Chart - Also filters by status
$revenue = Payment::query()
    ->whereYear('payment_date', $date->year)
    ->whereMonth('payment_date', $date->month)
    ->whereIn('status', ['paid', 'partial'])
    ->sum('amount');
```

### 2. Created Settings Feature

**Database Migration**: `2025_10_01_165014_create_settings_table.php`
- Gym name, email, phone, address
- Currency and currency symbol
- Timezone
- Operating hours (opening/closing time)
- Working days
- Logo upload
- About section

**Model**: `app/Models/Setting.php`
- Singleton pattern with `Setting::get()` method
- Casts for working_days (array) and times

**Controller**: `app/Http/Controllers/SettingController.php`
- `index()` - View settings
- `edit()` - Edit form
- `update()` - Save settings with logo upload

**Routes**: Added to `routes/web.php`
```php
Route::get('settings', [SettingController::class, 'index'])->name('settings.index');
Route::get('settings/edit', [SettingController::class, 'edit'])->name('settings.edit');
Route::put('settings', [SettingController::class, 'update'])->name('settings.update');
```

**Views**:
- `resources/views/settings/index.blade.php` - Display settings
- `resources/views/settings/edit.blade.php` - Edit form

### 3. Integrated Settings with Dashboard

**Updated**:
- `DashboardController.php` - Passes `$settings` to view
- `dashboard.blade.php` - Shows gym name in welcome message
- `layouts/app.blade.php` - Added Settings link to navigation (admin only)
