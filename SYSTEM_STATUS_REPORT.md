## 🔄 Business Logic

### Commission System
```
1. Member assigned to coach
2. Payment recorded (status: paid/partial)
3. Commission auto-created
4. Commission = Payment Amount × Commission Rate / 100
5. Commission linked to payment
6. Visible on coach dashboard
```

### Salary Payment
```
1. Coach has salary configured
2. Admin views coach details
3. System calculates: Salary + Commission (from paid fees)
4. Admin records payment
5. Expense created with type "Coach Salary"
6. "Already Paid" indicator appears
7. Next month: Form available again
```

### Membership Renewal
```
1. Member has active plan
2. Payment recorded
3. If payment >= plan fee:
   - Membership extended by plan duration
   - Status remains active
4. If payment < plan fee:
   - Status: partial
   - No renewal until full payment
```
