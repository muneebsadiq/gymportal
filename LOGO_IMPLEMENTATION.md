# Gym Logo Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

The gym logo uploaded by the admin now appears across the entire system, replacing the default "GymPro" branding.

## 📋 Features Implemented

### 1. Logo Validation (Max 400x400 pixels)
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/SettingController.php`

- ✅ Added dimension validation: `max_width=400,max_height=400`
- ✅ Custom error message showing actual dimensions if exceeded
- ✅ Automatic deletion of old logo when new one is uploaded
- ✅ Proper file storage in `storage/app/public/logos/`

```php
// Validation
'logo' => 'nullable|image|mimes:jpeg,png,jpg,gif|max:2048|dimensions:max_width=400,max_height=400'

// Manual check with detailed error
if ($image[0] > 400 || $image[1] > 400) {
    return back()->withErrors(['logo' => 'Logo dimensions must not exceed 400x400 pixels. Current size: ' . $image[0] . 'x' . $image[1]]);
}
```

### 2. Global Settings Availability
**File**: `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`

- ✅ Settings shared with ALL views via View Composer
- ✅ Available as `$globalSettings` in every Blade template
- ✅ No need to pass settings manually to each controller

```php
View::composer('*', function ($view) {
    $view->with('globalSettings', Setting::get());
});
```

## 🎯 Logo Display Locations

|----------|--------|------|
| **Navigation Bar** | ✅ | `layouts/app.blade.php` |

## 📐 Logo Specifications

- **Maximum File Size**: 2MB
- **Storage Location**: `storage/app/public/logos/`
- **Display Sizes**:

  - Receipts: 64px height (h-16)

## 🔄 How It Works

### Upload Process
1. Admin goes to Settings → Edit Settings
2. Uploads logo (validates dimensions)
3. System checks: width ≤ 400px AND height ≤ 400px
4. If valid: Saves to storage, deletes old logo
5. If invalid: Shows error with actual dimensions

### Display Process
1. `AppServiceProvider` loads settings on every request
2. Settings available as `$globalSettings` in all views
3. Views check if logo exists: `@if($globalSettings->logo)`
4. If yes: Display logo with gym name
5. If no: Show default icon/text

## 💡 Usage Examples

### In Navigation
```blade
@if($globalSettings->logo)
    <img src="{{ asset('storage/' . $globalSettings->logo) }}" 
         alt="{{ $globalSettings->gym_name }}" 
         class="h-10 w-auto object-contain">
@else
    <!-- Default icon -->
@endif
<span>{{ $globalSettings->gym_name }}</span>
```

### In Receipts
```blade
@if($globalSettings->logo)
    <img src="{{ asset('storage/' . $globalSettings->logo) }}" 
         alt="{{ $globalSettings->gym_name }}" 
         class="h-16 w-auto object-contain mb-2">
@endif
<h2>{{ $globalSettings->gym_name }}</h2>
@if($globalSettings->gym_address)
    <p>{{ $globalSettings->gym_address }}</p>
@endif
```
